        <h2>Mark Shephard</h2>
        <p>Are you a yes vote, or a no vote? It’s a common question these days ahead of the Independence Referendum this coming September, and thousands are still undecided, with many saying it’s due to lack of facts and information.</p>
        <p>But have any of you considered the impact that social media will have on your decision, whether your conscious of it or not?</p>
        <p>Mark Shephard, a Senior Lecturer at The University of Strathclyde has been undertaking a study to explore just that. So join us as Mark tells us all about the study which could tell us just how much influence social media has on our opinions towards independence. You never know; his wealth of knowledge may help cement your final decision!</p>

        <h2>Corinne Hutton</h2>
        <p>At 43, Corinne Hutton has not let her quadruple amputation hold her back from being a major fundraiser and starting her own charity, ‘Finding Your Feet’.</p>
        <p>As well as being a mother, she has completed challenging events such as The New York Marathon, The Rob Roy Challenge and The Kiltwalk and has even trekked in the Himalayas, raising funds for charities such as CHAS and Maggie’s Cancer Care.</p>
        <p>Despite having spent hours undergoing major surgeries, numerous hospital trips and life-changing challenges, this inspirational woman is not defined by her illness.</p>
        <p>Corinne will tell us the story of her journey, challenging what wealth really is and teaching us about how helping others, sharing experiences, and talking through your worries can really create a common wealth within communities.</p>

        <p>Rema was one of the first female radio journalists to work in Kosovo before she, her husband and their 3 sons were evacuated from a refugee camp in Macedonia in 1999.

        <p>A research and policy advisor in Oxfam’s Research Team, Katherine is responsible for exploring an economy that delivers social justice, good lives, vibrant communities and protects the planet.</p>
        <p>As well as managing Oxfam’s ‘Whose Economy?’, a project which asked why, despite decades of economic growth, Scotland’s poverty have not been addressed and inequalities have deepened, she also worked as a Research Fellow where she analysed community development and social housing.</p>
        <p>This, combined with a PHD in Political Science awarded from the Australian National University, has given Katherine great understanding of wealth, prosperity and the concept of community. Her talk will look at prosperity from the perspective of people, not pounds and profits and will give us an insight into the challenges and surprises of Oxfam’s Humankind Index; a measure of Scotland’s prosperity based on wide ranging community consultation.</p>

        <p>As the technology lead for the ambitious Glasgow Future Cities Demonstrator, a £24m project funded b the Technology Strategy Board, Colin knows a thing or two about how the latest technologies can positively impact cities.</p>
        <p>Colin’s work has led to him investigating the impact that technologies such as cloud computing, social media and open data can have on the management of cities like Glasgow, and in his talk, he will uncover how such technology will provide new opportunities for urban innovation and improve Glasgow’s connectivity. Drawing from real examples from the Future Cities Demonstrator project, this will be an interesting insight into the benefits of technology use in cities.</p>

        <h2>Martin Hendry</h2>
        <p>Ok, just for fun, jump. You landed again didn’t you? See, what goes up must come down, thanks to gravity - the thing that binds the galaxy together. It’s a thing Martin Hendry, Professor of Gravitational Astrophysics and Cosmology at The University of Glasgow, knows a lot about.</p>
        <p>Gravity and physics are two things we probably take for granted, largely because we don’t realise just how much of an impact they have on our every day life. When you get in your car and use your phone to direct you somewhere or take a picture on a digital camera, it’s all thanks to physics.</p>
        <p>It’s all quite mind boggling really, but thankfully, we have people like Martin who can make sense of it all. Working as a Series Consultant for the BBC, working on Richard Hammond programmes ‘How to Build A Planet’ and ‘How to Build A Universe’, he’s well used to engaging people and explaining just how amazing gravity and physics is. We’ll join Martin on an amazing journey of phenomena and science that will open up our minds.</p>

        <p>Josh is also the founder of The Scottish Business Awards, which rewards and recognises the success of Scotland’s businesses.</p>
<p>In his talk, Josh will recount the paths life has taken him, from bringing Bob Geldof and Bill Clinton to Scotland, to building a business that is truly challenging the norm and changing lives for the better.</p>

      <p>A leading health economist who has held chairs at numerous universities, published over 200 journal articles and co-authored several books, including Credit Crunch Health Care, Cam Donaldson has been assessing the impact of microcredit and social business on health and wellbeing.</p>
      <p>With a career spanning 30 years, Cam has developed a significant understanding of just how hand-in-hand wealth and health actually go, something that, if Glasgow is anything to go by, is hugely apparent across the world. Perhaps the 28-year life expectancy gab between the best and worst off in our city will help to cement that in our minds.</p>
